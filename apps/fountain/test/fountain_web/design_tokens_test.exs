defmodule FountainWeb.DesignTokensTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The design tokens exist twice and nothing built the second copy.

  `assets/css/tokens.css` is the source, with the reasoning in comments.
  `apps/fountain/priv/static/assets/tokens.css` is the file a browser actually
  loads, and it is the same declarations with the comments taken out. There is
  no bundler on this site (Tailwind is the play CDN and there is no asset
  build), so nothing generates the second file and nothing checked it.

  It had already drifted before these tests existed, and editing it by hand
  broke it in the way that is hardest to notice: half a comment survived, the
  parser swallowed the declarations after it, and the page rendered with three
  tokens silently empty. Every test stayed green, because a token that
  resolves to nothing is a background that does not paint, not an error.

  So: same properties, same values, same order, and no comment left half
  standing.
