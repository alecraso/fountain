  Does the OpenAPI document tell the truth about its own controllers (#1427)?

  Three defects of one class surfaced in a day, and nothing in the repository
  could catch any of them, because every existing check compares a schema with
  another schema:

    1. `AuthMeResponse.required` named `name`, `prefix` and `created_at`,
       properties the schema does not have, copied from `ApiKey` (#1417).
       `openapi-typescript` drops a required name with no property, so the
       published client had every field on that response optional.
    2. `AuthMeResponse` declares `expires_at`, which `show/2` never renders
       (#1418). The spec promises a field the endpoint does not return.
    3. Reported as a bare `{"type": "object"}` 402 on `POST /api/conversations`
       carrying an undeclared `upgrade_url`. Building this guard showed that
       one was not a server defect at all: the operation declares `error` and
       `upgrade_url` perfectly well, and `scripts/sdk-contract/build.py` was
       dropping the properties of an inline schema when it projected them.
       Fixed there. The check below still exists, because a response declared
       as a propertyless object is a real hazard even though nothing is in that
       state today.

  Each needs a different question asked, so this file asks three.

  **The rendered half** is not here at all — it is a telemetry handler attached
  in `test_helper.exs`, validating every response any controller test produces
  against the schema its operation declares. That is where defect 1 is caught,
  and it covers 146 operations for free because the tests already exist.
  `FountainWeb.SchemaGuardAllowlist` holds what is already wrong.

  **The static half** is `every declared response says something` below: a
  declared JSON response with no properties, no `$ref` and no type promises
  nothing, so no guard anywhere can disagree with it. It passes today and its
  job is to keep it that way.

  **The exhaustive half** is `renders every property it declares`, which catches
  defect 2. The rendered half cannot: an optional property that is never sent
  still validates. This one drives a real request and compares the keys that
  came back against the properties the schema declares, for the operations in
  `@pins` below where that is worth pinning.
