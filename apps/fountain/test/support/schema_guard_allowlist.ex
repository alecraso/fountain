defmodule FountainWeb.SchemaGuardAllowlist do
  @moduledoc """
  What the schema guard is allowed to find today, and why.

  The ratchet this repository already uses for the omissions list in
  `sdk/contract`: write down what is wrong now, forbid anything new, and let
  the list only shrink. Every entry is one `{operation, status}` pair — never a
  pattern — so a second operation with the same defect fails until somebody
  decides about it too. That is the whole point: the families below are
  systemic, and a wildcard would let the next instance in unnoticed.

  Cleaning one up means deleting its line. `FountainWeb.SchemaGuardrailTest`
  fails if the list grows past `@ceiling`, so growing it is a deliberate edit a
  reviewer sees.

  ## An extension's operations do not belong here

  This list is core's, and only core's. `apps/fountain` installs no extension
  (ADR 0043, and `config/runtime.exs` asks `Code.ensure_loaded?/1`), so the
  staleness check in `SchemaGuardrailTest` — "every entry names an operation
  the API still serves" — cannot see an extension operation and reports any
  entry naming one as stale.

  That is not a hypothetical. `{"POST /api/support/reports", 401}` sat here
  until #1528 deleted it as stale, and it was not stale: the operation had
  simply moved into `apps/fountain_support`, where nothing checked it either,
  because the schema guard could not resolve through `ExtensionDispatch` at all
  until #1536. A ratchet cannot count what it cannot see, and the entry looked
  like a fix landing.

  So an extension declares the statuses on its own operations instead — there
  were 8 of them across both extensions. Core pipeline responses are
  composed from router membership; controller-specific refusals stay explicit. `FountainWeb.ExtensionSchemaGuardCase` enforces it from each
  extension's suite, which is the only run that can.

  ## The families

  `:test_fixture_vocabulary` — not a defect in the API. The fixture inserts a
  value on purpose that the domain no longer accepts (a conversation whose
  runtime is `retired-runtime`, exercising the retired-runtime path), so the
  rendered enum is out of vocabulary because the test asked for that.
