defmodule Fountain.Conversations.ConversationServerAcpFixtureTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Conformance: a whole turn against a real ACP program (#1634).

  Every other test in this tree hand-feeds the protocol, so it proves what
  Fountain does with bytes it wrote itself. This one runs
  `test/fixtures/acp_agent.exs` as its own OS process, hands its stdio to a
  `ConversationServer` through `Fountain.FixtureAcpProcess`, and asserts on
  what lands in the transcript. Nothing in the loop knows the program, and
  the program knows nothing about Fountain.

  It is the acp runtime end to end: an agent that names a command, a turn
  with no model and no inference credential, tool-call and message blocks on
  the feed, the stop reason closing the turn, and a permission request the
  agent's policy answers.
