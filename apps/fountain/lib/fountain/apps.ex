defmodule Fountain.Apps do
  @moduledoc """
  Where the browser apps that sit on Fountain's API live.

  Fountain's own UI is a console — accounts, keys, agents, environments,
  vaults, audit, admin. Watching an agent work and messaging a teammate are
  separate single-page apps on their own origins, talking to `/api` with a
  bearer key (ADR 0021 gave them "Sign in with Fountain"). This module is the
  one place that knows their URLs, so the console's links, an email's
  "open it" and a forwarded support report all agree.

  Both default to the apps hosted on demo.managoat.com. They are ordinary static
  builds with **no server of their own**: the reader types their Fountain's
  URL in, so the hosted build works against a self-hosted Fountain as soon as
  that server admits the origin:

      API_CORS_ORIGINS=https://fountain-conversations.demo.managoat.com

  A deployment that would rather host its own copy points `CONVERSATIONS_APP_URL`
  and `TEAM_APP_URL` at it (and admits *that* origin instead). Setting either
  to an empty string says "this deployment has no such app": the console stops
  linking to it. Retired browser URLs return the normal 404 response.
