defmodule Fountain.Brand do
  @moduledoc """
  The name this deployment goes by.

  Fountain is the engine: the CLI, the API, the SDK, the env vars and the
  manual all carry its name, and none of that changes per deployment. What
  does change is what the *chrome* says: the sidebar header, the `<title>`,
  the sign-in page, the OAuth consent screen and the subject line of every
  email. A hosted deployment sold under another brand (`PRODUCT_NAME`) puts
  that brand there and nowhere else, the way GitLab.com is GitLab and Grafana
  Cloud is Grafana.

  The manual is the one place both names show up, on purpose: a reader of the
  hosted docs types `fountain auth login`, so the word Fountain has to be on
  the page. `hosted?/0` is what lets the docs layout explain that once, at the
  top, rather than the reader working it out.

  # `mark-mono.png` is the odd one: a single-colour drawing of the mark on a
  # transparent ground, which is what the marketing site (managoat/site) puts
  # in its chrome and behind its opening lines; the app only ships it. The app icon is a coloured tile
  # and cannot do that job — a page set in one ink cannot hold a second
  # palette in the corner — and the drawing is inverted rather than duplicated
  # for the dark theme, so one file serves both. A brand that supplies the
  # other six has to supply this one too.

  where swapping them means a rebuild of the engine for a change to the

  static host will do) holding `assets/0`; the engine's own files stay the
  default for everyone else.
