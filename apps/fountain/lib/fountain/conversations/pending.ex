defmodule Fountain.Conversations.Pending do
  @moduledoc """
  What a turn waits on a human for (#1375): the permission request the peer
  asked (#940).

  A value and the functions that add, answer, deny, expire and detach it.
  The value is the permission timeout; the request itself lives on the turn
  row, which is why a request raised before a deploy is still answerable
  after one. `from_state/1` reads the server field into a `%Pending{}` and
  `into_state/2` writes it back; the server's state does not change shape.

  This module also held the retired tool bridge's parked calls (#1202) —
  hence "a human *or a client*" in its original name. Those left with the
  dialects that fed them (ADR 0057, #2252); the permission half below is
  unchanged by that removal.

  Every function takes what it reads (the conversation id, the turn row,
  the peer) and returns what changed: the reply to hand back, the turn row
  and the next value. Timers are armed in the calling process, which is the
  server; the answers reach the peer (`Managoat.ACP.Peer`) from here, and the
  stage events say what happened on the stream.

  `ask`: the agent is blocked and a human has to answer (#940).

  Three things happen, and the order matters. The pending request is persisted
  on the turn first, so a deploy landing a millisecond later can still be
  answered; then the stage event goes out; then the timeout is armed.

  The timeout is not optional and it is not a tidiness measure.
  `Lifecycle.check/4` suppresses only the *idle* verdict while a turn is in
  flight, so an unanswered request would sail past the idle bound and be
  resolved by the max-lifetime ceiling — and per 0017 the idle bound suspends
  while the ceiling destroys. Left alone, a prompt nobody answers does not
  hang forever; it burns the whole lifetime and then takes the agent's memory
  with it (#649).

  That reasoning stops at the turn's end, which is what `detach/2` exists for
  (#1635): an agent that ends the turn waiting holds nothing open, so its
  request keeps `detached_timeout_ms` instead and the sweep fires it.

  Returns the turn row with the request on it (unchanged when there is no
  turn) and the value with the timer armed.
