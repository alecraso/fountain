defmodule Fountain.Conversations.Reapply do
  @moduledoc """
  Re-selecting a conversation's Agent, Environment and Vault (#1565).

  A reapply keeps the conversation, its id, its transcript **and its machine**.
  What it changes is what the machine is configured with, on the machine that
  is already there. The disk survives, so an agent's cloned repositories,
  uncommitted work and build output are still where it left them.

  ## What updates in place, and what does not

  Most of a launch configuration is either process environment or a file, and
  both of those can be rewritten under a running sandbox. The reattach path
  has always done exactly this — `ConversationServer.do_reattach/6` rewrites
  `.mcp.json`, the `.env` file and the instructions on every wake — so this is
  an established mechanism rather than a new one.

  | Change | How it lands | Rebuild |
  |---|---|---|
  | Environment variables, Vault values | Respawn the runtime with fresh env | no |
  | System prompt, skills, MCP servers | Rewrite the files | no |
  | Model, permission policy | Per-turn arguments | no |
  | Runtime (claude to codex, say) | Adapter install | **yes** |
  | Packages, repositories, setup script | Install, clone, run | **yes** |
  | Network policy | Egress rules, written once at provision | **yes** |

  The rebuild rows are not stubbornness. The ACP adapter is an npm install
  that provisioning deliberately does *before* the network policy is applied,
  so installing a different one later fails in a way that reads as a protocol
  bug. `git clone` refuses a checkout that already exists, and a setup script
  that starts services fails on its second run, which is the same reason
  `Provisioning.discard_interrupted_attempt/3` exists.

  The network policy is the cautious one. `Egress.apply_policy/4` runs once,
  at provision, and nothing has ever re-run it against a live machine. Rather
  than assume it is idempotent and find out in production, a networking change
  is refused. Relaxing that is a one-line change to `fingerprint/1`, once
  somebody has shown the re-application is safe.

  One gap is worth naming. A skill whose source is a GitHub repository is a
  clone, and by the time a reapply runs the machine's network policy is
  already in force. Bundled skills are file writes and always land; a remote
  one may not, under a restrictive policy.

  So a reapply that needs either of those is refused, and says which field
  forced it. Start a new conversation for that, or build the machine under
  the conversation again with `DELETE /api/sandboxes/:id` (#1071).

  ## The cotenant rule

  Skills, the instructions file and `.mcp.json` sit at per-sandbox paths
  (`Managoat.Runtimes.Layout`), not per-conversation ones, so rewriting them
  rewrites them for every conversation on that machine. Sharing only happens
  on a persistent home or an explicit `sandbox_id` attach, and
  `Conversations.check_attachable/4` already pins every conversation on a
  machine to one `(user, agent, environment, vault)`. A conversation that has
  the machine to itself can therefore be reconfigured freely; one that shares
  it may only be reapplied to the selection its cotenants already have, which
  is what a refresh is. The context applies that rule and reports it as the
  `:shared_sandbox` blocker below.

  Whether the machine `sandbox` already is can be reconfigured into the
  requested selection, or the first reason it cannot.

  `:built_with` is the Environment the sandbox records, used to name a changed
  build field after the stored fingerprint proves the inputs differ. It is
  mutable and cannot establish what an older machine was built from. A machine
  with no recorded fingerprint requires an explicit rebuild.

  ## What the refusal can name

  A refusal carries the build field that forced it only when the selection
  moves to a *different* Environment, because naming the field means diffing
  the one the machine was built from against the one being asked for.

  A refresh of the same Environment, edited in place, is the case that cannot.
  Both sides are the same row read fresh, so every field compares equal however
  far the build inputs moved. The stored digest still catches the move — it was
  computed before the edit — but nothing left on the row says *which* input
  changed, so the refusal is the general `:environment`. Recovering the field
  there needs the digest to be per-field rather than one string, which is a
  column change and not worth it for the message alone.

  Move the machine's binding identity to the selection just committed.

  The identity is what `Conversations.check_attachable/4` matches a later
  attach against, so it has to follow the conversation rather than stay on
  the machine's original three. A persistent home is unique per identity, so
  a move onto one that already exists comes back as a changeset error on
  `:home` and rolls the whole reapply back: two homes for one identity is
  exactly what the partial index exists to prevent.

  `applied_skills` is carried forward, not replaced. It records what is on
  the disk now, which is what the skills reconciliation compares against; the
  newly selected skills only become the recorded set once they are actually
