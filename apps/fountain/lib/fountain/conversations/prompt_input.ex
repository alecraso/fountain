defmodule Fountain.Conversations.PromptInput do
  @moduledoc """
  Validate opening input before a launch reserves a sandbox or creates a conversation.

  `validate_initial/1` runs as the first step of `start_conversation/2` on both
  the create and attach paths, ahead of the agent fetch and every reservation,
  so malformed input costs no machine.

  The rule is that images need words. A launch with neither is fine — that is
  how a conversation opens without a first turn — but images with a blank or
  absent prompt are refused, because the runtime is handed pixels and no
  instruction. The retired OpenAI-compatible controller decided the other way
  for its own dialect and synthesized a caption; that was a shim for clients
  that could not send one, never the native contract, and it left with the
  dialect (ADR 0057).

  The media-type and size checks repeat what `FountainWeb.PromptImages.decode/1`
  already did. That is deliberate: `decode/1` belongs to the two HTTP
  transports, and a context caller (`Fountain.Team`, a schedule, a future
  worker) reaches `start_conversation/2` without passing through it. The web
  layer's message is the friendlier one and still wins for HTTP callers,
  because it runs first.

  `attrs["images"]` is the **decoded** shape — `[%{media_type: binary, data: binary}]`
  with atom keys and raw bytes, which is what `PromptImages.decode/1` returns and
  what every caller already passes. This is not a preference. It is the shape the
  rest of the pipeline pattern-matches on, so accepting anything else here would
  only move the failure later and make it worse:

      Conversations._unsafe_insert_turn_images/2   fn {%{media_type: mt, data: data}, idx} -> ...

  `TurnMachine.store_images/2` is on every runtime's path
  (`ConversationServer.run_turn/6`, before sending the ACP prompt) and handles an
  `{:error, changeset}` by logging and continuing — but a key it cannot match
  raises `FunctionClauseError`, which is not an error tuple and which no `rescue`
  on that path catches. A validator that said `:ok` to a shape these consumers cannot
  read would trade a free refusal for a crashed turn on a sandbox the tenant had
  already paid to provision, which is the opposite of the point of validating
  here at all.

  So an image that is not the decoded shape is `{:error, :invalid_images}`, and
  a caller that has bytes of its own runs them through
  `FountainWeb.PromptImages.decode/1` first.
