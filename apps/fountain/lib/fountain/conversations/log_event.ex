  `state` as the API renders it: `nil` for an event that has no state.

  The column is `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`, so "no state" is stored as `""` on every
  row this table has ever held. The published schema says the field is one of
  `#{Enum.join(@states, " ")}` or `null` — `""` is neither, and a generated
  client with a strict enum decoder is entitled to reject an ordinary output
  event on the busiest read in the API (#1430).

  Converting here rather than on the way in keeps one representation on disk
  and one on the wire, with a single named conversion between them. Storing
  `nil` instead would mean dropping a `NOT NULL` on `log_events`, the
  highest-volume table in the system, and would still need this function for
  every row written before that migration.

  `stage` as the API renders it: `nil` for an event that has no stage.

  Follows `rendered_state/1`. `stage` has no enum to violate, so this is not a
  contract fix but a consistency one: an output event that answered `null` for
  its state and `""` for its stage would be describing the same absence two
  ways.
