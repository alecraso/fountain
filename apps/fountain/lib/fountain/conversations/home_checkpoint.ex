defmodule Fountain.Conversations.HomeCheckpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Checkpoint a persistent home when it parks (ADR 0023, #1073).

  A home's disk is the agent's memory across every conversation on it, so
  the moment it goes quiet is the moment its state is worth keeping. Where
  the provider advertises `:checkpoint`, both park paths — the
  `ConversationServer`'s idle and ceiling reclaim, and the reaper's park of a
  home with no live server — call `on_park/1` before flipping the row to
  `suspended`. The checkpoint id and time land in `sandboxes.provider_meta`
  (`checkpoint_id`, `checkpoint_at`) and a `checkpoint` stage is written to
  every live conversation on the machine, so each transcript shows it.

  What a checkpoint can restore, honestly: on Sprites a checkpoint is scoped
  to the sprite that created it (#654) and the SDK has no "create a sprite
  from a checkpoint", so it rolls *this* machine back and cannot rebuild a
  machine that is gone. The `{:machine_gone, …}` re-provision path therefore
  does not restore from it; a reset that rolls a home back to its last park
  is the path it is for. Ephemeral sandboxes are never checkpointed here —
  their disk dies with the conversation.

  Best-effort by construction: a failed checkpoint is logged and recorded as
  a failed stage, and the park goes ahead — an unparked machine keeps billing.
