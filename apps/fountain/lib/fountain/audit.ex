defmodule Fountain.Audit do
  @moduledoc """
  Append-only audit log for state-changing actions.

  Each event is attributed to a tenant via `user_id`. Pre-tenancy rows
  and system-originated events have `user_id = nil` and are only
  surfaced through admin views.

  Logging is best-effort: a log failure must never break the operation
  it's recording. Use `record!/1` only when you can tolerate raising;
  default to `record/1`.

  Best-effort means *rescuing*, which does not survive a transaction: a failed
  insert inside one aborts the enclosing transaction. Call this outside the
  transaction whose work you are recording — `Accounts.Deletion`,
  `Agents.upload_avatar/4` and `Accounts.register_user/2` all do.

  ## Where events come from

  Mutations audit **inside the context function**, not at each caller, so the
  UI, the API, background workers and any future surface are covered by
  construction rather than by remembering. Callers pass only what a context
  cannot know about its caller — `:actor` and `:request_ip`, from
  `FountainWeb.Audited.attribution/2` on a web surface, or a
  `"system:<worker>"` string from a background one.

  ADR 0013 owns this rule and the closed actor vocabulary (`self`, `ui`,
  `api`, `sprite`, `admin`, `admin:<id>`, `system:<worker>`); this moduledoc
  keeps the mechanics.

  The four conversation lifecycle events (`conversation.prompted`,
  `interrupted`, `terminated`, `released`) follow the same rule from the
  verb's owner: `Conversations.Termination.audit_lifecycle/5` records them
  after the server reply and outside any transaction, called from
  `Conversations.Termination`, `Conversations.Interruption` and the prompt
  door on `ConversationServer` (#2175). The interrupted-turn row writes
  (`Conversations.Interruption._unsafe_interrupt_turn/2` and
  `_unsafe_idle_interrupted_turn/1`, still reachable by their old names on
  `Conversations`) are conditional bookkeeping and record nothing themselves.

  ## Deliberately not audited

  High-volume machine state is not audit material, and recording it would bury
  the events that are. These are decisions, not oversights (#551):

    * `ConversationServer`'s per-turn state-machine writes — turn started,
      output chunk, turn ended. The conversation's own log events already hold
      this, at the right granularity.
    * `Accounts.touch_api_key/1` — a last-used stamp on every authenticated
      request. The key's *creation* and *revocation* are audited; its use is
      what the request log is for.
    * `Conversations.mark_read/2` and theme/preference updates — reading and
      display settings are not state changes anyone audits.

  One system path records a **summary per run** rather than per row, for the
  same reason: `Workers.RetentionPruner`, which deletes `audit_events`, so the
  trail must be able to account for its own shrinkage.
