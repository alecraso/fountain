  @moduledoc """
  A tenant-owned URL that lifecycle events are POSTed to.

  The signing secret is **encrypted, not hashed**, unlike `api_keys.key_hash`:
  we have to read it back to sign with it. That is what `Fountain.Crypto`
  envelope encryption is for, and it is the same path environment and vault
  secrets take. It is shown once at creation and once at each rotation, and
  never rendered again.

  `consecutive_failures` counts *events* that exhausted their retries, not
  attempts. It resets on any delivery the receiver accepted, so an endpoint
  that is merely flaky never trips the auto-disable, and one that is gone
  trips it in the low tens of hours.
