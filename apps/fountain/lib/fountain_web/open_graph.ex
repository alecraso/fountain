defmodule FountainWeb.OpenGraph do
  @moduledoc """
  The Open Graph / Twitter card every HTML page carries in its `<head>`.

  A link to the landing page, a docs page or the sign-in page unfurls in
  Slack, iMessage, X and LinkedIn with a title, a description and the card
  image at `/images/og-card.png` (1200×630). The values come from assigns a
  controller may set — `:page_title` and `:meta_description` — with a
  deployment-wide default for each, so a page that sets nothing still gets a
  sensible card rather than a bare URL.

  Absolute URLs are built from `:public_url`, never from the request host: the
  scraper's `Host` header is whatever it sent, and a card that quotes it back
  would let anyone mint one that points at a lookalike.
