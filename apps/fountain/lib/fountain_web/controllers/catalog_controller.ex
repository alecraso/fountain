  `GET /api/catalog`: the instance's vocabulary a client needs to build the
  agent and environment forms — runtimes and their model suggestions,
  the sandbox providers usable here and the default, the package managers
  an environment accepts,
  where this instance's browser apps live (#866), and the remote MCP
  servers verified to complete connection discovery (#1322), and the first
  request (ADR 0038).

  Everything here is already public through the forms; this is the same
  lists over the API so a client on another origin does not hard-code them
  and drift from the server. `first_request` is that argument applied to the
  onboarding snippet: the verified landing prints it, `docs/quickstart.md`
  prints it, and `fountain auth register` prints it, so the text has to come
  from one place or the three will disagree. `Fountain.Onboarding` is that
  place; this is how a client that is not the server reaches it.
