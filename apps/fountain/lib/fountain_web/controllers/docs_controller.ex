defmodule FountainWeb.DocsController do
  @moduledoc """
  Serves the public documentation manual at `/docs`. Content is embedded at
  compile time by `Fountain.Docs`; rendering goes through the sanitizing
  `Managoat.Docs.Markdown` pipeline, same as `/help` (#323).

  Public, like the front door, and deliberately so: since the GitHub Pages
  copy was retired (#1008) this route is the only published manual, and the
  people who most need it — someone deciding whether to self-host, or reading
  `setup.md` before they have an account — have no session to authenticate.
