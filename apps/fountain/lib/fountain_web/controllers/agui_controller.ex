defmodule FountainWeb.AguiController do
  @moduledoc """
  A Fountain agent answering as an [AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui)
  endpoint.

  `POST /api/agui/:agent_id` takes the protocol's `RunAgentInput` and answers
  with its SSE event stream, so an AG-UI host can register a Fountain agent
  knowing nothing about Fountain's own API — one URL and a bearer token. The
  host this was built against is CopilotKit's OpenBot, where a "Bot" is exactly
  that: an endpoint speaking AG-UI. See `docs/integrations/openbot.md`.

  ## The thread is the conversation

  An AG-UI host holds the transcript and replays the whole message list on every
  run, expecting the endpoint to keep no memory of its own. A Fountain
  conversation is the opposite: the sandbox holds the context, and feeding it
  back its own transcript each turn would be both wrong and expensive.

  So the thread is *mapped* to a conversation rather than replayed into one.
  `threadId` becomes the channel binding `agui:<threadId>` — the same mechanism
  the team page resumes on (#774) — and only the newest user message of each run
  is sent as a prompt. The first run on a thread opens the conversation; every
  later run prompts the one already bound. A host that starts a new thread gets
  a new sandbox, which is what starting a new channel should mean.

  The standing role (the host's `system`/`developer` messages) rides along with
  the first prompt only. Editing it afterwards reaches new threads, not the
  sandbox that already booted with it.

  ## One run is one turn

  `RUN_STARTED` goes out immediately, then the turn's log events are translated
  as they arrive, then `RUN_FINISHED` when the turn ends (`RUN_ERROR` if it
  failed). `text` blocks stream as the assistant's message. Everything else the
  turn does — `thinking`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, and the lifecycle stages,
  because provisioning a fresh sandbox takes a minute and silence reads as a
  hang — streams as AG-UI *thinking* events, which a host renders as reasoning.

  The sandbox's own tool use is never emitted as an AG-UI **tool call**. On
  this protocol a tool call means "host, run this and send me the result", and
  that is not what happened: a Fountain agent ran its own tool, inside its own
  sandbox, and already has the result. Reporting it as a call would ask the
  host to execute something twice and leave the run waiting for a result it
  will never be sent.

  The host's own `tools` are the other half (#1202, `Fountain.CallerTools`):
  they are served to the agent beside its own, and when it calls one the run
  ends with `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END` and `RUN_FINISHED` (`stopReason:
  "tool_calls"`) while the turn stays open. The next run on the thread whose
  newest messages are `role: "tool"` answers the calls and streams the rest of
  the turn.
