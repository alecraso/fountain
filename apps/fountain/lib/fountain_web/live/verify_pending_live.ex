defmodule FountainWeb.VerifyPendingLive do
  @moduledoc """
  The waiting room for a signed-in but unverified account (#533).

  Before this page an unverified login was bounced to `/auth/login` with a
  flash, which read as a failed sign-in even though the session was fine — and
  re-entering the password never actually helped, because the emailed link logs
  the user in itself.

  ## Auto-advance

  The page watches for verification landing elsewhere — the link opened in
  another tab, or on a phone — and sends the user on without a second login:

    * `Accounts.verify_email/1` broadcasts on `Accounts.verification_topic/1`,
      which is instant; and
    * a five-second poll backstops it, because the broadcast only crosses nodes
      when BEAM clustering is actually configured (`CLUSTER_DNS_QUERY`), and a
      page that silently fails to advance is the dead end this replaced.

  Both paths re-read the user from the database rather than trusting the
  message, so the redirect is never issued on a stale assign.
