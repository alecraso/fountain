  @moduledoc """
  The chrome every admin page shares: a title and the tab bar that names the
  other pages.

  `/admin` used to be one LiveView rendering six stacked sections, and its
  `mount` plus its ten-second refresh re-ran every query behind all six no
  matter which one you were reading. The sections are now pages, so a page
  loads its own data and nothing else, and this module is what keeps them
  looking like one panel.

  The tabs are the whole of the admin surface at the top level. The detail
  pages beneath them (`/admin/users/:id`, `/admin/conversations/:id`) render
  the same bar with `current` set to the section they belong to, so an
  operator who drilled in can still see where they are and get back out.

  Header for an admin page: an `<h1>`, an optional one-line description, and

  `current` is the tab to mark, as an atom. Pass the section a detail page
