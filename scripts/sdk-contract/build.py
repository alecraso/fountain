"""Turn the served OpenAPI document into the SDK wire contract.

The server is the only place the API is described. `mix openapi.export` renders
that description to `dist/openapi.json`; this script canonicalises that file and
projects it down to `sdk/contract/contract.json`, which is checked in and is
what the four SDK verifiers read.

Two files rather than one, because they answer different questions:

  dist/openapi.json      the whole document, vendor extensions off. Not checked
                         in — it is rebuilt from the server and it moves with
                         every prose edit and every release.
  sdk/contract/contract.json
                         shape only: operations, schemas, requiredness, enums.
                         Checked in, so an SDK check needs no Elixir toolchain,
                         and a diff on it is exactly "the wire changed".

What the projection deliberately drops is as important as what it keeps.
Descriptions, summaries, tags and `info.version` are not part of the wire, so a
docs pass or a release bump must not diff this file — if it did, the diff would
stop meaning anything and reviewers would stop reading it.

The one trap worth naming: a property with a `default` is NOT required.
`openapi-typescript` emits such properties as non-optional, which is why
`sdk/typescript/src/schemas.ts` carries an `Optional<>` re-relaxation for
`ScheduleInput`. Requiredness here comes from the schema's `required` list and
nothing else; `has_default` is recorded beside it. `--check` asserts this on
every default-carrying property so the bug cannot be baked into three more
languages.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/sdk-contract/build.py            # write both files
    python3 scripts/sdk-contract/build.py --check    # write dist/openapi.json,
                                                     # then fail rather than
                                                     # write a stale contract

    3.0 has no `"type": "null"`. `nullable: true` relaxes the type of the schema

    composition keyword must also be given null by that composition:

      * `allOf` — every branch must accept null, because the instance has to
        satisfy all of them.
      * `anyOf` — at least one branch must, because the instance has to

        one branch, so a schema like that rejects null even though every
        branch says it does not.

    The trap this exists for (#1899): a wrapper written as
    `{"nullable": true, "allOf": [{"$ref": ...}]}` reads as nullable and is not.
    The wrapper's own `nullable` is vacuous — it carries no `type` to relax —
    and the referenced schema is where `type: object` lives, so that is the
    branch that refuses null. Adding `type: object` to the wrapper does not
    help: the branch still refuses. Either the referenced schema carries
    `nullable: true` itself, or a union needs an explicit null-only branch.
