# Sobelow scan covering core AND ee/ (decisions/0010).
#
# Sobelow scans a single Phoenix app root: it needs root/mix.exs for the app
# name and a router among the scanned files, so it cannot scan ee/ directly
# (no mix.exs, no router). Instead we assemble a throwaway merged tree —
# apps/fountain's lib with ee/lib overlaid (their file sets are disjoint by
# construction; the move was pure renames) — and point sobelow at that. This
# reproduces the exact pre-#472 scan, when the ee files still lived in core.
#
# Callers: `mix precommit` (scripts/precommit.sh) and .github/workflows/ci.yml.
