# Runs the documented self-host quick start verbatim against the image the
# tree pins, then asks the app what the walkthrough asks and what the
# retirement in ADR 0057 promises. Two workflows run it, and it is one script
# so they cannot drift:
#
# Note which version the answers describe. The pin is the *last release*, so
# on a PR and on main this asks about the release a new user would pull, and
# only on the tag does it ask about the tree being released. An assertion
# here is therefore a statement about shipped behaviour, and may not be added
# before the release that makes it true: the retired-dialect checks below
# could not land until v0.18.0's pin did, because v0.17.1 still served all
# five paths.
#
#   ci.yml       "Compose boots the pinned image" on every PR and main push,
#                skipped when the pinned tag has no image yet (a release
#                bump PR, and main right after it merges).
#   release.yml  the same check on the tag, after image-manifest has
#                published the image the bump pins, before the GitHub
#                Release is created.
#
# The exact commands the quick start documents (cp, the two openssl lines,
# up) rather than a synthetic env: the check exists to run what a fresh user
# runs, so any divergence here would defeat it. The two appended keys are
# the only definition of each: the example file ships them commented out, so
# a followed quick start no longer leaves two copies of every secret in .env,
# shadowing each other and relying on last-value-wins (#1215).

# The retirement has to hold in the artifact, not just in the suite.
# `protocol_retirement_test.exs` pins all of this, but a suite pass is not
# evidence about the image: the tree it tested and the release someone pulls
# are different objects, and this repository has shipped a prod-only no-op
# that every test passed (the runtime image had no coreutils). The four
# `/v1` answers and the `/api` ones below need no API key, so the whole
# matrix that does not need an account is checkable here, on the image, for
# the cost of six requests.
#
# The three answers are deliberately different and all three are load-bearing
# (ADR 0057 carries the correction): `/v1` is unrouted, so it is 404 before
# any authentication runs; `/api/...` is routed as far as the API pipeline,
# so a keyless call is 401 and an `Accept: text/event-stream` is refused by
# content negotiation with 406 before dispatch. A client probing for a bare
# 404 to detect the cutover reads the other two as something else, which is
# why a regression in any single one of them matters.
