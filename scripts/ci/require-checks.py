# max_entries_to_build: 1 — the org is on the free plan, which allows 20
# concurrent GitHub-hosted jobs. A full mixed PR runs 25 jobs; a merge group
# runs 26 because both probes run. Speculating
# two groups deep cannot run two groups; it queues the second behind the first
# while also starving every open PR. Raise this only after the concurrency
# ceiling does.
#
# min_entries_to_merge: 2 with a 5 minute wait — batching is the only lever
# that buys throughput under that same ceiling, because five PRs merged as one
# group cost one 26-job run instead of five. In a burst the group fills at once
# and nothing waits; in a quiet hour a lone PR waits up to five minutes, which
# is the hour where nobody is blocked on it.
#
# ALLGREEN, not HEADGREEN: a group merges only when every entry passed, which
# is the entire reason to run a queue over a tree nobody tested.
