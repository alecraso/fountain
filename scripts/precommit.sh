# The local gate behind `mix precommit`: CI's Elixir static job, the sobelow
# scan, a prod release assemble and the test suite, in that order, as one
# command whose exit status is the verdict.
#
#   mix precommit                 every stage
#   mix precommit credo test      only those stages, in the canonical order
#   mix precommit --list          the stage names and what each runs
#   scripts/precommit.sh          the same thing without the alias
#
# Every stage is its own OS process, so no stage can leave Mix state behind
# for the next one, and the script never trusts a stage's output: a non-zero
# status stops the run, the summary names the stage, and that status is the
# script's own. `mix precommit` hands it to the shell with `System.halt/1`,
# so nothing sits between the failed stage and `$?`.
#
# One thing the script cannot fix: a pipe. `mix precommit | tee log` reports
# tee's status unless the shell has `pipefail` on. Read the last line, which
# is always `precommit: PASSED` or `precommit: FAILED ...`, or set pipefail.
#
# What CI runs that this does not: hex.audit, the Go modules, the release
# BOOT (this assembles only; booting needs SECRET_KEY_BASE and a database),
# OpenAPI validation and the SDK jobs. scripts/ci/README.md lists them all.
