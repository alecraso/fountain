# Upgrade an instance

This guide shows you how to move an instance to a newer Fountain release, and
what to do when an upgrade goes wrong.

## Before you start

Take a backup. An upgrade is the one moment where the supported path back
needs one. Read [Back up and restore](back-up-and-restore.md).

Read **Upgrade notes** in the [changelog](../../changelog.md) before a minor
bump.

## How versions work

Fountain follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/), before 1.0. A patch release,
`v0.3.0` to `v0.3.1`, is always safe to take. A minor release, `v0.3` to
`v0.4`, can break something. The changelog calls each break out under
**Upgrade notes**.

Each release publishes the server image to `ghcr.io/managoat/fountain`
under two tags, next to the tags that track development.

| Tag | Moves? | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `vX.Y.Z` | Never. | To pin a known version. This is the default we suggest. |
| `vX.Y` | To the newest patch in the line. | To take patches on their own, with no risk of a minor that breaks something. |
| `latest` | On each merge to `main`. | Nothing you keep in production, because it moves under you. |
| `sha-<commit>` | Never. | To reproduce exactly what one commit built. |

## Two distributions

Each tag above names the **bundled** image: the server plus the first-party
extensions, which is what this project has always published. Each release also
publishes the same version with a `-core` suffix.

| Tag | Contains |
|---|---|
| `vX.Y.Z` and `vX.Y` | The server, the Buzz extension and the support extension, plus the `buzz-acp` and `buzz` executables the Buzz extension runs. |
| `vX.Y.Z-core` and `vX.Y-core` | The server. No extension, no extension route, no extension migration and no extension executable. |

Use the bundled image unless you know you want the other one. The hosted
deployment runs it, and we triage a bug report against it.

The core image is smaller and has less surface to attack. It is also what to
build an extension of your own against. The cost: hosted Buzz agents
(`/api/buzz/agents` and the Nostr harness) and the problem-report endpoint
answer `404`, because the code that serves them is not installed.

To move between them, pull the other tag and restart. Extension tables stay in
the database. A core image does not create them. It also does not drop the ones
a bundled image made, so a move back finds your rows where you left them.

Releases v0.2.1 and earlier are older than the image tags. They exist as
`sha-` tags alone.

## Build your own image

`BUNDLE_EXTENSIONS` is a build argument, defaulting to `true`. It selects the
release's applications and extension executables when Docker builds the image.
Setting it on a running container does not change its distribution.

```bash
# Bundled: Fountain, Buzz and Support.
docker build --build-arg BUNDLE_EXTENSIONS=true -t fountain:bundled .

# Core: Fountain without first-party extensions.
docker build --build-arg BUNDLE_EXTENSIONS=false -t fountain:core .
```

For a release built directly from the source tree, use
`BUNDLE_EXTENSIONS=false MIX_ENV=prod mix release fountain_server` to select
core. Omit the variable, or set it to `true`, to bundle the extensions.

## Take a new version

The compose file reads `FOUNTAIN_IMAGE_TAG` from `.env`, and
`.env.compose.example` ships it set to a pinned release. A fresh install is
therefore pinned by construction. Leave the variable unset and the compose
file still falls back to a pinned release, and not to `latest`.

To upgrade, edit that value, then pull.

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run on their own at boot. They are idempotent, and a Postgres
advisory lock serializes them. Replicas that roll do not race each other. You
run no manual migration step, unless a release's upgrade notes say to.

A migration that builds an index concurrently opts out of that lock by design.
Fountain writes such a migration so that a second run is safe.

Did you move migrations into a Job with `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false`? Then the Job
is the upgrade step. Read
[Run migrations in a Job](database.md#run-migrations-in-a-job).

## Principal credential expiry

Every unrevoked key with `principal` scope must have an expiry. The database
CHECK enforces this independently of the issuer. Full and sprite keys can
still omit expiry. Existing deadlines and revoked keys remain unchanged.

The application now rejects a principal key write without an explicit expiry.
The database trigger still supplies 30 days for older writers during a rolling
upgrade. This release installs and validates the permanent CHECK in separate
migrations, so validation does not hold the installation's exclusive table lock.
A timeout leaves validation pending; retry after you resolve the contention.

Principal issuance, claim replay and owner renewal supply deadlines starting
with [commit af1178dd](https://github.com/managoat/fountain/commit/af1178dd2b3462eb7a26e9d655ff3fe09681a0ed).
This is a verified code boundary, not evidence that every deployed replica
uses it. No published release floor for trigger removal is established here.

Before a later migration removes the trigger, finish a deployment containing
that writer change and this validation. Confirm all older replicas, workers
and release-task processes have stopped. Include any external database writers
in that check. Boot migrations can run before replacement replicas serve
requests, so the trigger cannot disappear in the first rollout of new writers.
[Issue #2103](https://github.com/managoat/fountain/issues/2103) tracks that remaining step.

## Match the CLI to the server

The CLI and the server come from the same tag. The two versions that match are
the pair we test.

The CLI's built-in default `base_url` is the hosted instance,
`https://managoat.com`, and not yours. Point it at your instance
before you export an API key. Otherwise the first command you run without a
config sends that key to the hosted domain.

```bash
FOUNTAIN_BASE_URL=https://your-fountain.example.com fountain auth login
```

`auth login` records the URL in the saved profile, so you do this one time.

## Watch a deploy land

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/fountain -n fountain   # k8s
docker compose logs -f app                               # compose
```

A rollout that never completes usually means the startup probe fails, and that
means migrations that cannot finish. The readiness probe can also fail,
against a database problem that is older than the deploy. Read
[Pods restart or never go ready](../../troubleshooting/pods-restarting.md).

## When an upgrade goes wrong

Here are the rules, best first.

1. **Roll forward.** Pin `vX.Y.Z` tags, read **Upgrade notes** before a minor
   bump, and fix forward when something breaks.
2. **Do not downgrade once a newer version's migrations have run.** We do not
   support it. The supported path back is to restore the pre-upgrade database
   backup and run the previous image. You then lose the writes since the
   backup. That is why a backup before each upgrade is cheap insurance.
3. `Fountain.Release.rollback/2` exists to reverse one migration that you
   understand. Do not attempt to reverse a whole release's migrations on
   production data.

If a restore crosses an upgrade boundary, run the image version that matches
the dump.
