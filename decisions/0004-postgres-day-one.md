# 0004 — Postgres from day one (drop the SQLite path)

**Status:** Accepted — 2026-05-09.

## Context

The Phase 2 engineering plan (`plan/phase-2-build-plan/engineering-plan.md`) raised OQ-1b: SQLite + WAL on a Render persistent disk for launch, or Postgres? The plan's working assumption was SQLite, justified by aod-ex's existing use of it and by the modest scale of the 100-WAU success metric. Postgres was framed as a later cutover.

Two facts pushed the decision the other way at G2:

1. **The cutover has a real cost and risk profile.** A SQLite→Postgres migration mid-product means coordinating a downtime window, validating data parity, and reworking infra (replace persistent disk, add managed Postgres, swap `DATABASE_URL`, retest backups). Done well it's a sprint; done badly it's an incident. Doing it once, at G2, while the schema is still ink-on-paper, removes that risk entirely.
2. **The SQLite path required Litestream for any meaningful PITR.** OQ-9b would have added Litestream + S3 to the launch infrastructure list. Managed Postgres backups are a single line of `render.yaml` configuration and a known commodity for the operator. Strictly less infrastructure to learn.

aod-ex's reference value ([ADR 0002](0002-aod-ex-as-reference.md)) is in the schema and the contexts, not the storage adapter. Ecto abstracts both backends; the migration files differ only in field types where Postgres-specific features (`jsonb`, `uuid`, `bytea`) are clearly preferable.

## Decision

Fountain ships with **managed Postgres** as its only relational store from launch. The SQLite + Litestream path described in earlier drafts of the engineering plan is removed.

Concretely:
- `render.yaml` declares a managed Postgres database, exposes `DATABASE_URL` to the web service, and removes the persistent disk that SQLite required.
- Ecto repo configured for `Ecto.Adapters.Postgres`.
- Schema definitions use `jsonb` for `metadata` columns (`usage_events`, `admin_audit_events`), `binary_id` (UUID) for primary keys, and `bigint` for the append-only event PKs.
- All new tables use UUID v7 (separate decision, OQ-1c) — the time-ordering benefit is realized on Postgres B-tree indexes specifically. *(**Never built** — primary keys are UUIDv4; see Addendum 2026-08-02.)*
- Backups: rely on Render's managed Postgres daily backups + PITR. No Litestream needed; OQ-9b is N/A. *(Superseded — see Addendum 2026-08-02.)*

## Consequences

- One less pending migration on the roadmap. Sprint 1 onward writes Postgres-native schemas directly; no abstraction layer needed to keep the SQLite option open.
- Operational floor rises slightly: a managed Postgres line item on Render replaces the cost of a small persistent disk. Within tolerance for the launch budget.
- Schema and query review can use Postgres-specific features without restraint — `jsonb` operators, partial indexes, `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, etc. — when they pay for themselves.
- If a future product line truly needs an embedded single-tenant deployment (a Fountain Lite distributed as a single binary), that's a separate product with its own storage decision; this ADR does not constrain that.
- Reversal cost: low at G2 (no production data exists). Once production data exists, reversing this is a Postgres→SQLite migration, which is materially worse than the cutover this ADR avoids. Treat as effectively irreversible after launch.

## Alternatives considered

- **SQLite + Litestream at launch, Postgres cutover later.** The original engineering-plan default. Rejected: pushes a known migration into a future sprint, requires Litestream tuning the operator hasn't done before, and saves only the cost of a managed Postgres line item — not enough to justify the future-toil debt.
- **SQLite at launch, no Litestream, accept the backup gap.** Rejected: Render persistent disks are not cross-AZ replicated; a disk failure would lose data between snapshots. Unacceptable for a paid product (G2 chose a hard billing gate, [ADR 0006](0006-hard-stripe-billing-gate-at-launch.md)).
- **Postgres-compatible managed serverless (Neon, Supabase) instead of Render-managed Postgres.** Rejected for launch: adds a vendor relationship and egress considerations that aren't justified before there's evidence Render's managed Postgres is the bottleneck. Easy to revisit if it becomes one.

## Addendum — 2026-08-02

Two claims above no longer match (or never matched) the code:

- **UUID v7 was never built.** Every schema uses `@primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}` (e.g. `apps/fountain/lib/fountain/accounts/user.ex`), which generates `Ecto.UUID` values — **UUIDv4**. No v7 library is in the dependency tree. The B-tree time-ordering benefit claimed above therefore does not exist. If time-ordered ids become necessary, that is a new decision (and a migration), not something this ADR delivered.
- **Backups are no longer Render's.** Production Postgres is CloudNativePG on the home-cloud Kubernetes cluster; backups are handled by `k8s/backup-cronjob.yaml`, `k8s/objectstore.yaml`, and `k8s/scheduledbackup.yaml`. The "Render managed backups + PITR" line is superseded. The core decision (Postgres from day one, no SQLite path) stands and is unaffected.

## Amendment — 2026-09-14: the Postgres on-ramp includes demos

**Re-examined and reaffirmed** in
[#1579](https://github.com/managoat/fountain/issues/1579#issuecomment-5660991693),
following the initial acceptance on 2026-09-11. The demo is the product:
ADR 0004 applies to it too. Fountain accepts that value arrives after
commitment and competes on something other than time to first look. For a
self-hosted first run, generating keys, starting Compose and Postgres,
learning Agent, Environment, Vault and Conversation, and supplying inference
credentials precede the first reply. Using the hosted service moves database
operation to its operator; it does not remove the account requirement.

The three paths considered in #1579 are disposed of explicitly:

- **Ephemeral single-tenant mode:** rejected. In-memory or SQLite state would
  add a second storage path and an ongoing maintenance and CI obligation for
  the sake of a first impression. No database-free demo mode is commissioned.
- **Hosted try-it without signup:** rejected. Throwaway identities and a
  pre-funded public instance create an abuse surface, real spend on strangers
  and an operating burden. A fleet ceiling bounds those costs without
  eliminating them. No anonymous hosted demo is commissioned.
- **One command against the real service:** remains worthwhile on its own
  merits. `fountain quickstart` (#1391) already exists; collapsing registration
  through verification through the first reply is not delivered by this
  decision. It still needs an account and the service's Postgres database,
  so it is not a zero-account, zero-database path. Revisit this option first
  if evidence warrants improving the on-ramp.

goatherd is a signup-free way to run the component libraries, not Fountain's
adoption on-ramp or an exception to this decision. Its boundary is recorded
in [ADR 0055](0055-hosted-fountain-and-local-control-planes.md).

**Revisit with evidence:** if adoption stalls because of the on-ramp
specifically, rather than findability, reconsider against the standing goal
of 100 weekly active users by November 2026. A comparison with another
product's `npx` experience alone does not reopen the decision. The adoption
tracker is [#1585](https://github.com/managoat/fountain/issues/1585); this
decision creates no demo implementation follow-up.
