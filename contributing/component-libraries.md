# Component libraries: the extraction and graduation recipes

**Further extraction is paused** (ADR 0037, addendum of 2026-09-14). Nine
database-free subsystems left the server as Apache-2.0 `Managoat.*` libraries
and all nine are on hex; every one of them now costs two PRs per cross-seam
change. A tenth is worth that coordination only when a consumer outside
Fountain needs it, or when it needs a release schedule of its own. Until one
of those is true, a subsystem stays where it is, behind whatever module
boundary the compiler already enforces. The recipes below are kept for the
day that changes, and for a fix that has to land in a graduated library.

| Library | Owns | Fountain keeps |
|---|---|---|
| `managoat_substitution` | `Managoat.Substitution`, the `${VAR}` engine | |
| `managoat_mcp_auth` | the client side of MCP authorization: RFC 9728/8414/7591 discovery and registration, the SSRF guard, and since 0.2.0 (#2152) `Managoat.McpAuth.Client`, the OAuth 2.0 code flow behind Connections | provider rows, the verified catalog; `Fountain.Connections.OAuth` maps a Provider onto its Config |
| `managoat_oauth` | the OAuth 2.0 code+PKCE and device-grant state machine, a `use` macro over `Managoat.OAuth.Host` | `Fountain.OAuth` is the instance; its host mints the API key |
| `managoat_acp` | the client-side ACP session (Peer), Protocol, Permissions, Blocks, Usage, Tracer, the ScriptedAgent | `Conversations.Blocks` |
| `managoat_sandbox` | the sandbox behaviour, the Sprites/E2B/Daytona adapters, Retry, the Fake, the conformance case | `Fountain.SandboxProviders`, the "which providers are enabled" policy |
| `managoat_docs` | the compile-time embedded manual as a `use` macro, the markdown renderer, `GuardrailCase` | `docs/`, `nav.yml`, `Fountain.Help`, the prose gates, the `/docs` controller |
| `managoat_broker` | the native egress credential proxy behind `Managoat.Broker.Store` | the store over `broker_sessions`, the listener, the egress log |
| `managoat_runner` | the self-hosted runner wire protocol, the sandbox adapter over it, the FakeDaemon, behind `Managoat.Runner.Host` | `Fountain.Runners.Host` over Horde; the runners table, placement, presence |
| `managoat_runtimes` | how claude/codex/gemini/opencode get into a sandbox speaking ACP: the behaviour, the pinned adapter table, Layout, Instructions, Quirks, Model, Skills, the FakeRuntime | the model catalog, the bundled skill content, the ask timeout, `InferenceCredentials` |

Each is pinned `~> 0.1.0` in `apps/fountain/mix.exs` and lives in the
repository `managoat/managoat_<name>`. The umbrella holds no library app
today; `umbrella_layout_test.exs` and `scripts/test-libraries.sh` guard the
next one. Taking a new library release into Fountain is a pin bump PR here,
and that PR is the only place the new version is exercised against Fountain,
so do not skip its gates.

## Adding an umbrella library app

A new library starts as an app in this umbrella, `apps/managoat_<name>`,
and graduates once its surface stops moving. The model to copy is the last
extraction as merged, `git show 1b848031 -- apps/managoat_substitution`
(#1347, the smallest), or `managoat/managoat_substitution` on GitHub minus
what the graduation template added. A new one needs:

- `apps/managoat_<name>/mix.exs` with the three umbrella path lines
  (`build_path`, `deps_path`, `lockfile`) and deliberately **no**
  `config_path`: `config/runtime.exs` calls Fountain modules, so a library
  pointed at it cannot boot from its own directory. The library's tests must
  pass with no config at all (set what they need in `test/test_helper.exs`
  or per test). Plus `package` metadata with `licenses: ["Apache-2.0"]`, and
  its own `test_coverage` threshold.
- `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0, copy `cli/LICENSE`), `README.md`, `.formatter.exs`,
  `test/test_helper.exs`.
- A line in `apps/fountain/mix.exs`: `{:managoat_<name>, in_umbrella: true}`.
- A `COPY apps/managoat_<name>/mix.exs` line in the Dockerfile's deps layer,
  beside the existing one. Without it `mix deps.get` fails in the image
  build, which CI does not run.
- No reference to `Fountain.*` or `FountainWeb.*`, no
  `Application.get_env(:fountain, …)`, and no `[:fountain, …]` telemetry
  anywhere under its `lib/` or `test/`. The library takes what it needs as
  arguments or reads its own otp_app.
- If the library's `test/test_helper.exs` writes its own config (a test
  host, a stub name), Fountain's `apps/fountain/test/test_helper.exs` must
  set the value Fountain needs for that same key, with a comment. `mix test`
  at the umbrella root runs every app in one VM, so a library helper's
  `put_env` is still in effect when Fountain's suite starts (#1352 lost ten
  runner tests to this). CI never sees it, since the partitions and
  `scripts/test-libraries.sh` are separate VMs; `mix precommit` does.

`apps/fountain/test/fountain/umbrella_layout_test.exs` checks every one of
those and fails the suite on a miss. The root gates already reach the new
app: `mix format` through `subdirectories: ["apps/*"]`, credo through
`apps/*/lib/`, dialyzer and `mix test` because they run at the root. In CI
the library's tests run from `scripts/test-libraries.sh` in one partition
and their coverage export joins the merged gate, so a library with no tests
fails the run rather than passing unmeasured. Add a changelog fragment and
update the "Built so far" block in decisions/0037.

## Graduating a library

The reverse of the section above: an `apps/managoat_<name>` app leaves this
umbrella for a repository of its own, `managoat/managoat_<name>` (the same
string as the hex package), from which CI publishes it to hex, and
`apps/fountain` pins the hex release. The recipe is `scripts/graduate-library.sh`
plus `templates/managoat-library/`; #1345 wrote both and proved them on
`managoat_substitution`, then ran them for the other seven.

**When.** A library graduates when it has stopped moving: its public surface
has not changed since extraction, or its last change was a release of its own
rather than a fix that a Fountain PR needed the same day. There is no open
issue that needs a change on both sides of the seam. Until then the umbrella
gives the compile-time boundary at no release cost; after, every cross-seam
change costs two PRs (below).

**Prerequisite, org admin only.** The publish workflow authenticates with
`HEX_API_KEY`, an organization-level secret on `managoat` visible to every
repository, holding a write key from the hex.pm user account that owns every
`managoat_*` package. There is no hex organization and hex has no trusted
publishing; that key, used only by CI, is the mechanism. Listing org secrets
needs a scope your `gh` token may not have, so the check is to use it: the
first publish run of a new repository either works or fails with 401. On a
401, stop and ask; never create a key, and never put one in a repository
secret or a file.

**The script.** From the umbrella root, on a clean and up-to-date `main`:

```bash
scripts/graduate-library.sh --prepare-only <name>   # nothing on GitHub yet
scripts/graduate-library.sh <name>
```

`--prepare-only` runs the preflight and builds the stand-alone tree in a
scratch clone with the local gates, and stops. Do that first: a hex package
name is claimed by its first publish and can never be released, and the name
in `mix.exs` is permanent from the moment `main` exists. The full run then:

1. refuses unless the tree is clean, `main` matches `origin/main`, and
   `mix hex.build` succeeds for the app (a git dependency fails it; hex takes
   hex packages only, which is why `managoat_sandbox` waited for the Sprites
   client's hex release, pinned exactly to `0.2.0` for the reason in its
   `mix.exs`);
2. `git subtree split -P apps/managoat_<name>` puts the app's history on
   `graduate/<name>` (one commit per app today, the extraction PR; an
   `--unshallow` fetch first if the clone is shallow);
3. creates the repository (public, no wiki, topic `managoat-library`) and
   pushes the split as `main`;
4. in a fresh clone, copies the template in, takes the three umbrella path
   lines out of `mix.exs`, points `@source_url` at the new repository, adds
   `ex_doc` (so `mix hex.publish` publishes hexdocs too), credo and dialyzer,
   writes the repository's own `mix.lock`, runs compile, credo, the tests and
   `mix hex.build` locally, and pushes `chore: stand alone (...)`. That push
   is what runs CI and the first publish;
5. creates the `no-release` label and protects `main` behind the two checks,
   `ci` and `release gate`, with no review requirement, since a library
   repository's `main` is what publishes and the gate is what keeps it honest.

It is idempotent after a failure in 4 or 5: rerun it and it skips what exists.
The template it copies mirrors the SDK's release automation
(`.github/workflows/sdk-publish.yml`, `sdk-release-gate.yml`,
`scripts/sdk-release.mjs`): `scripts/release.exs state` reads `@version` from
`mix.exs` and asks hex whether it exists; `guard <base>` fails a PR that
changes `lib/`, `priv/` or the consumer-facing part of `mix.exs` without a
bump, a bump whose version hex already has, or a bump without a
`## [<version>]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging a bump publishes and tags
`v<version>` as a record; a docs-only merge finds nothing to do. The template
carries a Postgres service block that only `managoat_oauth` keeps (the script
strips it for the others) and action pins copied from `ci.yml`; Dependabot
maintains them from there, and the checkout-pin trap from this repository
applies: a Dependabot bump can move the SHA and leave the version comment
behind, so trust the SHA.

**What the script does not do: the Fountain-side PR.** One per library, opened
only after the hex release exists and only after the previous library's PR has
merged (two open at once conflict on `apps/fountain/mix.exs`, the Dockerfile
and the table above):

- delete `apps/managoat_<name>`;
- `{:managoat_<name>, in_umbrella: true}` becomes
  `{:managoat_<name>, "~> 0.1.0"}` in `apps/fountain/mix.exs`;
- drop its `COPY apps/managoat_<name>/mix.exs` line from the Dockerfile;
- `mix deps.get`, then `mix deps.unlock --unused`;
- the table above, the "Built so far" block in decisions/0037 (then
  `scripts/decisions-index.sh` and `okf validate decisions`), and a changelog
  fragment under `changelog.d/`;
- the gates: `mix precommit` (which runs `umbrella_layout_test.exs` and every
  remaining library's suite), `scripts/test-libraries.sh`, and
  **`docker build --target build .`**. The last one matters most: the
  Dockerfile's deps layer is the only consumer of the hex release that CI does
  not exercise, since CI never builds the image. After the merge, watch
  `build.yml` on `main` go green.

`umbrella_layout_test.exs` and `scripts/test-libraries.sh` walk whatever
`apps/managoat_*` directories remain, so they need no edit per library; with
zero apps the test skips its per-library assertions and the script exits 0
with a message. The `config :managoat_*` lines in `config/*.exs` stay: a hex
dependency reads its otp_app configuration the same way an umbrella app did.

**Ordering: a library that depends on another graduates after it.** Hex
refuses `in_umbrella` dependencies, so the dependency must be on hex first.
`managoat_runner` depends on `managoat_sandbox` and is the worked example:
sandbox graduates to hex; sandbox's Fountain-side PR deletes
`apps/managoat_sandbox` **and, in the same PR**, changes
`apps/managoat_runner/mix.exs` from `{:managoat_sandbox, in_umbrella: true}`
to `{:managoat_sandbox, "~> 0.1.0"}`, because an `in_umbrella` dependency on
an app that no longer exists cannot resolve, so the switch cannot be a PR of
its own after the deletion. The umbrella then resolves it from hex like
Fountain does, `mix hex.build` for runner succeeds inside the umbrella (that
PR's gate), the runner conformance suite still passes; then runner
graduates.

**The cost that starts on graduation day.** A change across the seam is two
PRs: a bump in the library (its gate insists), then a pin in Fountain. The
version pins here are `~> 0.1.0`, patch-level while every library is 0.x, so
a library's `0.2.0` reaches Fountain only when someone bumps the pin, on
purpose. A merged-PR branch push runs no CI here, so the pin PR is the only
place the new version is exercised against Fountain; do not skip its gates.
Merges into a library repository are yours once its CI is green, because its
`main` is what publishes. This cost is the reason extraction is paused.
